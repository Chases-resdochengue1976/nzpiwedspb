omg just got out of kimge kereksin and my brain’s still doing backflips!!! like, seriously, i can’t even. theater was like this huge echoey bubble of noise, kids laughing, someone dropped their popcorn and it was like dominoes falling everywhere. and this  ??? it’s like my mind just went into a washing machine.

> i mean, there’s this scene where all the colors burst like those paint-filled balloons we used back in training for that one wild act, my eyes were just drinking all the colors like i was thirsting in a desert. but then there was this musical bit — felt like juggling flaming torches while blindfolded, SO intense. couldn't help but imagine the dancers were barely floating, like my hands when learning silk aerials.

back was aching like after four hours of tightrope walk but you know what? totally worth it. and that weird part where everything seems to slow down, like when a clown stretches time just to make you laugh harder. i think it was about finding yourself, or, like, if you’re meant to swan-dive into the unknown. or something like that. did i mention someone interrupted a super quiet part with a ring tone? still managed to not break the spell.

> darn, i forgot who was asking to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  . people should really just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . maybe bring a pillow for the back, though.

oh, and that one guy, i swear from our circus act! they all seemed to be at the edge, trying to peer over reality’s fence. definitely sharing the juggling secrets, i think, just without saying a word. my brain’s turning into a spinning top just thinking about it.

brain static, for real. but i'll be dreaming of this for weeks. gahhh... note to remind me to stop eating leftover candy floss from coat pockets. but hey, if you get a chance, like, really sink into it. just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩, who knows where you’ll land.
